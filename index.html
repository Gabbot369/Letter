      <p>Dear Marian,</p>
      <p>If you read this letter, I want to sincerely apologize for all I did to you, for making your life worse.</p>
      <p>You mean a lot to me, and I hate that I let you down. I can't sleep at night thinking how bad I treated u, I realized I am the red flag, I am the one that doesn't give you much time, I am the one that doesn't understand you, I am the one who broke our future together, I am the worse person on our relationship, I am the one who makes some of your dreams failed, and I feel guilty for treated u that.</p>
      <p>I hope that you forgive me for all I did to you, I promise I will be better person, I promise I will make you proud, I promise I will achieve all my dreams even if you're not with me pursuing it. Forget the letter that I write to you that says "may our paths never crossed again" I want our paths crossed again and meet the best version of ourselves not because to be back to each other but because to see for ourselves that we achieve the dream that we pursue.</p>
      <p>I hope peace nata ✌️ I wrote this letter para di na heavy ako heart na guilth ko and goodluck pursuing your dreams! 🩷🤍 </p>
      <p>sorry sa grammar 😭</p>
